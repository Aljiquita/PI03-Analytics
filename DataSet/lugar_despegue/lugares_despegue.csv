Shortly after takeoff, while climbing to a height between 1,000 and 2,000 feet, the aircraft became unstable, lost height and crashed in a huge explosion in a field located two miles from the airfield. Several eye-witnesses reported that the aircraft lost some pieces before it came down. Investigations determined that following the failure of a part of the right aileron, it detached from the wing, causing severe vibrations. The crew tried to maintain a flat attitude but the aircraft banked left and right and then went into a spin when both wings separated due to aerodynamic forces that exceeded their certification. In such conditions, control was impossible.;Myrtle Beach

The KC-135 was completely destroyed when its fuel load ignited, killing all four crew members. The B-52G broke apart, killing three of the seven crew members aboard.At the time of the accident, the B-52G was carrying four B28FI Mod 2 Y1 thermonuclear (hydrogen) bombs, all of which fell to the surface. Three were found on land near the small fishing village of Palomares in the municipality of Cuevas del Almanzora, Almería, Spain. The non-nuclear explosives in two of the weapons detonated upon impact with the ground, resulting in the contamination of a 0.77-square-mile area with radioactive plutonium.

The aircraft was observed to make what appeared to be a normal takeoff and departure. At 00:47 the crew reported on base leg for Runway 1, and the controller cleared the flight to land. A subsequent discussion revealed that they would execute a simulated two-engine out approach, execute a full stop landing and then takeoff on runway 19.

The Salt Lake control center had, in response to its vector request, informed the crew that there were no storm cells and no reports of icing along the airway being used. As a result, the pilot was unaware that turbulence encountered would be hazardous, worse than that predicted at the time of take-off. These turbulent conditions apparently caused the uncontrolled descent of the aircraft into the ground. The pilot was technically not qualified for the type of aircraft and was aware of the general weather conditions and should have discontinued the flight..;Buckley ANGB

A progressive failure in the aircraft's electrical system leading to the disabling or erratic performance of some critical flight instruments and flight instrument lighting while the flight was operating in night instrument meteorological condition. As a result of these conditions, the flight crew could not resolve the instrumentation anomalies to determine proper aircraft attitude reference, and became disoriented and lost control of the aircraft. The crew's efforts to regain control of the aircraft imposed aerodynamic loads which exceeded design limits of the aircraft and caused it to break up in flight.;Ogden, UT

Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner.;Bandar Abbas

The crew was working with a filight plan that showed the course in tenths of a degree  instead of in the usual whole degrees. When the flight plan indicated 0270 degrees, the crew should have been flying at 027 degrees. Instead they flew at 270 degrees (west).Therefore, the crew flew in  the wrong direction, even though Belem was north of Maraba and the sun was setting right in front of them. Then they assumed they had overshot Belem and flew straight back east. Then they began following a river which they assumed was the Amazon which would lead them to Belem, but it was the Xingu river. Finally, they  tuned in a radio station and homed in on it assuming it was a Belem station, which it wasn't.;Maraba

After departing, the captain turned the aircraft to the right instead of to the left. The first officer advised the captain he should be turning left and ATC also asked about the direction taken. ATC then cleared the aircraft for a right turn. Soon after, the pitch decreased rapidly accompanied by a marked speed increase and plane entered a high speed, high-rate, spiral descent and crashed into an open field. The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. The first officer made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. The captain dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. The captain took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive. The commander was not systematically acquainted by Crossair with the specific features of western systems and cockpit procedures. Specifically both pilots  had trained in the Soviet Union, where the attitude indicator works differently. Theirs show an icon of the airplane changing position in front of a fixed horizon, mimicking what an observer outside the plane would see if there was daylight; but western type indicators show a fixed airplane icon and an artificial horizon changing position, mimicking what the pilot would see.

The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air traffic controller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air traffic controller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air traffic controller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly, one-and-a-half years later, the controller, Peter Nielsen, was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident.;Moscow

The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn't get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromou, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control had been  left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists.

The pilots' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane's autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C.";Baltimore, Maryland

It was dark with light rain at the time of the accident. The copilot was at the controls but it was the captain who taxied the plane into position for take off. The copilot was the lone survivor. The flight crew's failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to this accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversation during taxi, which resulted in loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.;Lexington

An investigation showned that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted; most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. The ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, and should have been melted by the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE).  However, the FOHE did not heat its own inlet  face, and investigation showed that, although the flight was   within the certified operational envelope at all times, a long   period of low fuel flow in an unusually cold environment, followed  by a throttle increase, could cause an ice jam at that point.

The sudden loss of power to both engines that resulted from impact with a red-tailed hawk, which fractured the windshield and interfered with engine fuel controls and the subsequent disorientation of the flightcrrew members. Also the lack of FAA regulations and guidance at the time the helicopter was certificated requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes and the lack of protections that would prevent T-handles from inadvertently dislodging out of the detents and the lack of a master warning light and audible system to alert the flightcrew of low-rotor speed conditions.;Bayou Penchant

Preliminary evidence suggests the crew selected the landing gear down and set the flaps 15 degrees. Immediately after selecting the flaps the stick shaker activated. The captain then pulled on the controls, slowing the airplane even further causing the plane to stall. Colgan Air officials acknowledged that both pilots apparently were not paying close attention to the aircraft's instruments and failed to follow the airline's procedures for handling an impending stall in the final minutes of the flight. The captain’s inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crew’s failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crew’s failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captain’s failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan Air’s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.;Newark, N.J.

This applied the brakes, causing a downward pitch force that  prevented the plane from rotating to take off. They made the fatal mistake of failing to abort the takeoff, but kept applying more upward  pitch with the result that when the plane finally left the ground and the downward pitch force stopped, it went into a stall within seconds.";Yaroslavl

The pilot also did not report the plane's emergency until it was too late. In addition, as the fuel was running out, they extended the flaps and gear just before the engines stopped, but this caused enough drag that they could no longer glide to the airport. Since the captain was part owner of the small airline, he was motivated to cut fuel costs because the company was in financial trouble.;Santa Cruz, Bolivia
